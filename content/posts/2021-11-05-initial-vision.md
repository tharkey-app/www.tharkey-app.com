As an occasionnal runner/hiker/biker, I like to explore new roads, new ways. Friends and family is sometimes a bit scarry: where have you been. We tried to call you but your phone was on mute... What if they could simply check where I am via an easy to use website?

And then, if they can track me during training sessions, why not adding some interactivity: live pictures and videos, cheers and messages from friends, ...

Also at the heart of Tharkey, I want to have privacy. No one else than the user can decide who has access to its geolocalization data.

As a professional software developer, I hope I will enjoy the design and developpment process, and let's see where it ends.
